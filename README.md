## Features
***
- 	**Frontend Development:** Leveraged Bootstrap and PHP to design and implement 
    the user interface of the Health Facility Employee Status Tracking System, 
    ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
-   **Database Design:** Utilized Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD) to architect the underlying MySQL database, ensuring efficient data organization and relationship mapping to support complex queries and operations.
- **Backend Functionality:** Implemented CRUD operations to enable comprehensive data management within the system. Employed MySQL triggers for real-time alert emails upon specific data conditions and configured MySQL events for automated, scheduled email dispatches.

### Trigger

1. **Warning Email**

2. **Schedule must within the next 4 weeks**
   ![](img/2.png)

3. **Employee can not schedule without 6-month vaccine**

## E/R to Relation conversion
***
**Facilities (name, type, address, city, province, postal\_code, phone\_number, web\_address, capacity)**

**Key:** name

**FD:** {name ‚Üí address, city, province, postal\_code, phone\_number, web\_address, capacity }

In relation Facilities, we assume the name is unique, hence name is the primary key in Facilities.

**WorkAt (name, MCN, **** role, start\_time, end\_time)**

**Key** :name, MCN

**FD:** {name, MCN‚Üí role, start\_time, end\_time }

**Constraints:** A new employee cannot be assigned to a facility if the current total number of employees currently working for the facility is equal to the capacity of the facility

Since WorkAt is a many to many relation between Employees and Facilities, both keys of two relations need to form a key of relation WorkAt.

**Schedule (****reference\_number****, name, MCN, date, start\_time, end\_time)**

**Key:** reference\_number

**FD:** {reference\_number‚Üí name, MCN, date, start\_time, end\_time }

**Constraints:** Start time less than the end time. An employee cannot be scheduled at two different conflicting times neither at the same facility nor at different facilities. If a nurse or a doctor is infected by COVID-19, then he/she cannot be scheduled to work for at least two weeks from the date of infection. An employee cannot be scheduled if she/he is not vaccinated, at least one vaccine for COVID-19 in the past six months prior to the date of the new schedule.

In relation Schedule, we set the reference number as unique, hence the reference number is the primary key in Facilities.

**Employees (****MCN****, first\_name, last\_name, date\_of\_birth, telephone\_number, address, city, province, postal\_code, citizenship, email\_address).**

**Key:** MCN

**FD:** {MCN ‚Üí first\_name, last\_name, date\_of\_birth, telephone\_number, address, city, province, postal\_code, citizenship, email\_address}

Every employee has a unique MCN and it can not be null, hence, MCNis the only primary key in Employees.

**Infection\_history** (MCN, date, type, times)

**Key:** MCN, date

**FD:** {MCN, date ‚Üí type, times}

Infection\_history is a weak entity set, so the key of Infection\_history needs to be a discriminator which is date combined with the key from the strong entity set which is MCN to form a key of Infection\_history.

**Vaccination(MCN, dose,type,location,date)**

**Key** : MCN, dose,type

**FD:** {MCN, dose, type ‚Üí location, date}

Vaccination is a weak entity set, so the key of Vaccination needs to be a discriminator which is combined with the key from the strong entity set which is MCN to form a key of Vaccination

**Email** (date, name, emailSubject, eEmail, body,)

**Key** : date, name, emailSubject,

**FD:** {date, name, emailSubject ‚ÜíeEmail, body}

Table Email is used to store the history of all emails sent by the system. Date, name, and email Subject bonded together to form a primary key which can search for specific email that was sent.

## Normalization Process Details
***
Normalization Process Details

Show the relation is 3NF, we need to check the at least one of the following holds:

1. The left hand side of each nontrivial FD is a superkey
2. The right hand side is part of any key of R

Show the relation is BCNF, we need to check:

1. The left hand side of each nontrivial FD is a superkey

We will test every table is in 3NF and possibly in BCNF:

**Facilities (type, name, address, city, province, postal\_code, phone\_number, web\_address, capacity)**

FDs: {name ‚Üí address, city, province, postal\_code, phone\_number, web\_address, capacity }

{name}+ = Facilities

For the only FD in Facilities, the left hand side is a key.

Hence, the relation is in BCNF

**WorkAt (Fname, MCN, role, start\_time, end\_time)**

FD: {name, MCN‚Üí role, start\_time, end\_time }

{name, MCN}+ = WorkAt

Since every FD in ManagedBy, the left hand side is a key.

Hence, the relation is in BCNF

**Schedule (reference\_number, name, MCN, role, start\_time, end\_time)**

FD: {reference\_number‚Üí name, MCN, role, start\_time, end\_time}

{reference\_number}+ = HistorySchedule

Since every FD in Schedule, the left hand side is a key.

Hence, the relation is in BCNF

**Employees (MCN, first\_name, last\_name, date\_of\_birth, telephone\_number, address, city, province, postal\_code, citizenship, email\_address).**

FD: {MCN ‚Üí first\_name, last\_name, date\_of\_birth, telephone\_number, address, city, province, postal\_code, citizenship, email\_address}

{MCN}+ = Employees

Since every FD in Employees, the left hand side is a key.

Hence, the relation is in BCNF

**Vaccination (MCN, dose, type,location, date)**

FD: {MCN, dose, type ‚Üí location, date}

{MCN, dose, type}+ = Vaccination

Since every FD in Vaccination, the left hand side is a key.

Hence, the relation is in BCNF

**Infection\_history (MCN, date,type, times )**

FD: {MCN, date ‚Üí type, times}

{MCN, date}+ = Infection\_history

Since every FD in Infection\_history, the left hand side is a key.

Hence, the relation is in BCNF

Therefore, for every FDs in each relation, we have proved that all relations are in BCNF which means they are also in 3NF.
